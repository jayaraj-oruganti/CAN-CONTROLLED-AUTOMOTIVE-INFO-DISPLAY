# CAN-CONTROLLED-AUTOMOTIVE-INFO-DISPLAY
Objective of this project is to design and implement an embedded system capable of monitoring and displaying critical vehicle parameters such as engine temperature, fuel level and indicator status. The system leverages the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol to enable reliable communication between sensor nodes and the dashboard display module
